Subject: Quantum Thermodynamics Software Collaboration Proposal

Dear q-bit.eu Team,

I'm reaching out regarding potential collaboration on quantum software for thermodynamic applications. I've developed a Proof of Concept implementing quantum algorithms for calculating thermodynamic properties of quantum magnetic systems.

**What I've built:**
- Quantum algorithm (VQE) for Transverse Field Ising Model ground states
- Validation against classical methods (2-4 qubits)
- Ready for hardware deployment (Qiskit compatible)
- GitHub: https://github.com/shellworlds/TFIMTDMVEQ

**Why this matters for q-bit.eu:**
1. Software validation for your hardware
2. Application-specific benchmarking
3. Joint research proposals (EU Quantum Flagship, national grants)
4. Publications and IP in quantum thermodynamics

**Current findings:**
- Perfect results for 2-qubit systems
- Emerging challenges at 3-4 qubits (research opportunities)
- Clear path to 8+ qubit implementations

**Proposed collaboration:**
1. Technical discussion of hardware-software integration
2. Joint proposal for quantum thermodynamics research
3. Pilot deployment on q-bit.eu hardware
4. Co-development of benchmarking suite

**Next steps:**
- Review POC at: https://github.com/shellworlds/TFIMTDMVEQ
- Schedule 30-minute technical discussion
- Explore funding opportunities

I believe our complementary expertise (your hardware, my software focus on thermodynamics) could create valuable research and business opportunities.
