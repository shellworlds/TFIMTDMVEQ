Subject: Quantum Thermodynamics Software Proposal

Dear [Recipient Name],

I am writing to propose collaboration on quantum software for thermodynamic applications. I have developed a Proof of Concept implementing quantum algorithms for material property calculation.

PROJECT SUMMARY:
- Name: Transverse Field Ising Model Thermodynamics via VQE
- Technology: Quantum algorithm (VQE) for ground state calculation
- Status: Working POC validated against classical methods
- Repository: https://github.com/shellworlds/TFIMTDMVEQ

KEY RESULTS:
- Perfect quantum-classical agreement for 2-qubit systems
- Small errors at 3-4 qubits indicating research opportunities
- Foundation for thermodynamic property extension
- Ready for quantum hardware deployment

COLLABORATION OPPORTUNITIES:
1. Software validation for quantum hardware
2. Joint research proposals (EU/national grants)
3. Application development for materials science
4. Publications and IP generation

NEXT STEPS:
1. Technical discussion (30 minutes)
2. Review of POC results
3. Funding opportunity identification
4. Proposal development timeline

I believe this work aligns with [their focus area] and could create valuable synergies between our efforts.

Please let me know your availability for a brief discussion.
